This contains the user authentication, guide screen and data input ui, as well as linking to Firebase for login and guide for survey input. 
This portion should be run through the WebStorms IDE. We used React Native CLI for Android.
You can follow instructions to install and setup React Native CLI at this link: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Once that is installed/setup according to the link, run an Android emulator through Android Studio. 
Then open the project in WebStorms IDE. Run 'react-native run-android' in the terminal.
The app should start to build and eventually run on the emulator. There you will be able to view the UI.
